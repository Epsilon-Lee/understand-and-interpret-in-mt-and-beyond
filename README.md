## Understanding and Interpretability in NMT and Beyond

A curated list and categorization of works about understanding and interpretability of the (Neural) Machine Translation Framework.

### Organization principle

1. Propose a high-level common issue/question these group of works try to resolve, i.e. what kind of understanding/knowledge of NMT is lacked currently in our community?
2. How these group of works are organized to discuss and resolve the issue?
  - Try to summarize their core arguments in a logical way (coordinate, step further)
